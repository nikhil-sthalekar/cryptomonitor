# cryptomonitor

The purpose off this app is to monitor cryto prices and recommend trades.

Currently ETH, DAI, BAT, $$$ is what I want to track.

The idea is that DAI and the DSR is worth more than ETH if ETH is falling or is stable.  If ETH goes up significantly I need to come up with a way to reinvest the DAI from DSR into ETH. This same thing works for BAT, and will potentially work for anything closely tied to these quantities.

Ehh I'm just spitballing here, let's see how it turns out.
